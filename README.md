### ðŸ§  Who Am I?

> "I don't just want to use AI â€” I want to understand it deeply and build with it."

I'm Kshitij â€” an E&TC student who's fallen in love with the world of **Machine Learning** and **Generative AI**.  
Every day I dive deeper into models, data, algorithms, and architectures â€” trying, failing, learning, and improving.

- ðŸ’» **Currently Learning**:  
  - Machine Learning foundations & math  
  - CNNs, RNNs, and Transformer-based models  
  - Building models in TensorFlow & Keras  
  - Evaluation, explainability, and optimization techniques  

- ðŸŒŸ **Goal**: Use ML to solve real-world problems, and build things that make an impact
